# MkDocs briefly

Before entering in the core of the matter, a brief presentation of MkDocsÂ : it is a static site generator in Python with a focus towards project documentation. The documentation source files themselves are written in Markdown and the configuration is written in a single YAML file.
It is possible to customize the theme used by MkDocs and there is already a very good Material theme available which will be used throughout this post.
There are also several plugins that can greatly help with your documentation. We will see some of them in this post.
